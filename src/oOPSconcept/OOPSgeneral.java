	// OOPS - Object Orientated Programming Concept
	
	// 1. Inheritance: building relation of sub/child class-super/parent class between classes, sub/child class can inherit property from parent/super class
	// 2. Polymorphism: in inheritance relation, then instance/object of a class can be created in multiple forms 
	// 3. Method Overriding: in inheritance relation, if method signature is same between classes - method in sub-class will override method in super-class
			// Method Overloading Vs Method Overriding
	// 4. Encapsulation: data hiding, medicine inside capsule
	// 5. Abstraction: different class/method than regular
	// 6. Interface: also java file like class -> class Vs interface
